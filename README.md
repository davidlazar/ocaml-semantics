# About

This is a formal semantics of the [Objective Caml](http://caml.inria.fr/) programming language.
We aim to define at least the subset of OCaml that is defined by [OCaml Light](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~so294/ocaml/).
Our definition is developed with the [K Semantic Framework](http://k-framework.org).
